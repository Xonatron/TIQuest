# TI Quest -- TI-99/4A RPG
GPT-5 vibe-coded MVP RPG in TI Extended BASIC for the TI-99/4A Home computer.

## Purpose
- Testing GPT-5 in coding a TI-99/4A home computer game in TI Extended BASIC. Both the computer and language were released in 1981, 44 years ago.

## GPT-5 Issues
There is likely a lack of learning due to the [TI Extended Basic manual](https://archive.org/details/ti-extended-basic-1981) manual not being converted into text, anywhere I have found it, on the internet.
- Confused TI BASIC for having TI Extended BASIC features, such as multiple-statements per line (via :: operator).
- Was not aware multiple-statements per line do not support REM statements as final line, such as ```10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD!" :: REM Hello World!```.
- Was not aware TI Extended BASIC allows comments at the end of lines (in some other fashion than above).
- Confused that TI Extended BASic only allows variable name lengths of 2 characters, although the [TI Extended Basic manual](https://archive.org/details/ti-extended-basic-1981) says ["one to 15 characters"](https://archive.org/details/ti-extended-basic-1981/page/n19/mode/2up) which I tested to work up to 8 characters.
